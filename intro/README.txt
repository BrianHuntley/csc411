I did not work with classmates, programming partners, or course staff on this assignment. I used the idioms handout to figure out how to load files in brightness.c. I also used the Pnmrdr handout to figure out how to use that interface.

As far as I know brightness.c works as intended. In fgroups.c, there are some exceptions that I could not figure out how to implement. It does not stop the user from entering keys or values that are too large to handle. It also does not truncate names that are too long.

Part C: This project could be used to sort through databases. For example if you had a database that was full of information about people, you would be able to use this to select a group of people based off of traits they share. 
	This code can also be used to test the security of a cryptographic algorithm. It can be used this way by testing thousands of inputs to see if a collision occurs.  

I spent about 9 hours on this assignment.
