I did not work with classmates, programming partners, or course staff on this assignment.

Phase 1:
	Phase one simply compares the string that the user enters to a hardcoded password. If the string matches the password the phase ends, otherwise it blows up.

Phase 2:
	Phase two expects 6 integers as input. The integers should be the previous integer plus the index of the previous integer.

Phase 3:
	Phase three expects 2 integers as input. The first integer is used to select what value to use as a password, and the second integer must match this password.

Phase 4:
	Phase four expects 2 integers as input. The program calls func4, which is a binary search algorithm. Func 4 is always called between the values 0 and 14. The value returned by this function is the number of guesses the algorithm needed to make. The first digit of is the value searched for by func4. To end the phase, func4 must return 1, and the second input must equal 1.

Phase 5:
	Phase five expects a string that is 6 characters long. The input is put through a cipher which translates a character of input to a character in a hardcoded string. The solution is a string which after being put through the cipher is "flames". There are multiple possible solutions.

Phase 6:
	Phase six expects 6 integers, all of which must be between 1 and 6, and there must be no repeats. Each digit corresponds to a hardcoded value. The values are then stored in a linked list. The solution is the order of digits with values in ascending order. 


I spent about 15 hours on this assignment.
